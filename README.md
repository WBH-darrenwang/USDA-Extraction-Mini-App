# USDA Extraction Mini App
</br>
This is a modified version of my previously made Splash application for extraction the data from USDA. </br> </br>

Being aware of what you are eating is vital in achieving a balanced diet. I hope this extremely simple app can help you easily have an insight on what you are eating.
